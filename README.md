## What is does?
This app demostrates the new framework for Machine Learning by Apple called CoreML  üí™üèª. 
<br><br>
It basically determines dominant objects in the scene from thousands of categories such as  :man:,  :deciduous_tree:,  :red_car: etc.<br>

The app works simply by tapping to capture a photo  :european_castle: , passing it through the CoreML model  :arrow_right:, and determining the object based on the confidence level  :thumbsup: .<br>

Additionally, it also speaks up  :speaker: the object determined, with the idea of helping the blind or people with poor vision to determine things .<br>

The app uses a simple open source CoreML model called as [SqueezeNet](https://github.com/DeepScale/SqueezeNet)
